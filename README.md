# FarmConnect

FarmConnect is an integrated platform which helps farmers to monitor their farms and get experts advice on how to increase the yield of their crops. The platform has 2 major components-

1. The Robot - which is deployed on the field to monitor different soil characterstics like moisture, pH level and environmental conditions like the temperature and humidity. The data collected by the bot will be stored in a server which can be accessed by farmers using their registered account on the web/mobile platform.

2. The App/Web platform - is an interface for users to access their farm's soil conditions and share that data with experts in order to seek advice on which crops will give maximum yield. 

The FarmConnect Bot(Prototype v1)

A fully-functional bot which captures soil data, monitors environmental conditions and send it to the Blynk server. The bot uses Arduino and NodeMCU as the hardware platform and Blynk App for controlling the bot and monitoring sensor data.
